#### This is my submission for PA1 (Experiment 1 | Introduction to Python Programming)
#### Part 1:
##### The first part of this code aims to create a function that takes a string, and returns it with its letters in alphabetical order. 



#### We were instructed to (1) Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order. (2) Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticons. (3) Unpack the list into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.
