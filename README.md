#### This is my submission for PA1 (Experiment 1 | Introduction to Python Programming)
#### We were instructed to (1) Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order. (2) Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticons. (3) Unpack the list into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.
